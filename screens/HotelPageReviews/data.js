I had emailed prior asking for a bottle of Cava in one of the rooms as a surprise for a birthday, and it was there when we arrived in an icebucket. Complementary too, which was really appreciated.",

    description: "Keep returning to the Soho Hotel in Barcelona and will continue to do so for one reason - The staff here are amazing, friendly and couldn't do more for you. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. I am due to return to Barcelona in November and will only stay at the Soho. I would rather change my travel dates than try to find another hotel. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made another stay perfect!",
